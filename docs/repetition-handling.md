# Repetition handling

Whisper-family decoders (and other ASR models that accept a conditioning prompt) sometimes lock onto the prompt and emit it back near-verbatim instead of transcribing the new audio. This document describes how `vad-transcribe-py` detects and recovers from those failures.

## Layers of defense

There are two complementary mechanisms, applied in order:

1. **Forward filter** — before a transcription is used as the conditioning prompt for the *next* segment, `conditioning_context()` (`vad_transcribe_py/_utils.py`) drops it if it is empty, internally repetitive, or a near-duplicate of the prior line. This prevents the model from being primed to repeat itself on the next call.
2. **Per-call retry** — after the model returns, the backend checks whether the output near-duplicates the prior segment. If so, it re-runs the inference without the conditioning prompt and keeps the second result. This recovers segments that have already been corrupted by prompt echo.

Both layers use the same near-duplicate test: `is_near_duplicate()` in `vad_transcribe_py/_utils.py` — case- and whitespace-insensitive `SequenceMatcher` ratio ≥ 0.9.

## Per-call retry behavior

Implemented in three backends:

| Backend | Conditioning arg removed on retry |
|---|---|
| `whisper` | `prompt_ids` |
| `qwen-asr-rs` | `context` |
| `qwen-asr-mlx` | `system_prompt` |

Each `transcribe()` call retries **at most once**. If the retry output is also a duplicate, it is accepted as-is (the audio may genuinely repeat, e.g. a chant).

### Single-text path

Used by `qwen-asr-rs`, `qwen-asr-mlx`, and `whisper` with `--no-sub-timestamps`.

The model returns a single string per VAD segment. If a conditioning prompt was passed in **and** the returned text near-duplicates the prior VAD segment's joined text (`_prior_line`), the call is repeated with the conditioning argument set to `None`.

### Sub-timestamps path (whisper only, default)

Used by `whisper` with `--sub-timestamps` (the default). The HuggingFace pipeline returns multiple chunks per VAD segment with their own start/end timestamps, so the comparison is finer-grained.

The backend walks the chunk list looking for the **first** index `i` where `chunks[i].text` near-duplicates its predecessor:

- For `i == 0`: predecessor is `_prior_last_chunk` — the last chunk emitted by the previous VAD segment. This catches cross-VAD prompt echo.
- For `i ≥ 1`: predecessor is `chunks[i-1].text`. This catches mid-VAD-segment repetition (the model loops within a single call).

When a duplicate is found, the audio is trimmed to start at `chunks[i].timestamp[0]` and re-run with `prompt_ids` dropped. The retried chunks have their timestamps re-based by `+ trim_start_sec` and spliced in: `chunks[:i] + retried_chunks`.

**Retry gating differs by where the duplicate sits:**

- `i == 0` (cross-VAD): retry **only if** an initial prompt was used. With no prompt to remove, retrying with identical audio and args would produce the same result.
- `i ≥ 1` (mid-VAD): **always retry**, even without an initial prompt. The audio trim itself is a meaningful change in input — removing the looping audio gives the model a chance to produce a non-repeating output.

## Clipping single-line repetitions (opt-in)

Even after the per-call retry, a few segments can slip through with degenerate output the model couldn't recover from — a single word looping for the rest of the VAD window (`"… some real speech then dungu dungu dungu dungu …"`) or a single character repeated dozens of times (`"好好好好…"`). These loops carry no information for downstream consumers, but the prefix before the loop often does.

The `--clip-repetitions` flag (off by default) on `vad-transcribe-py transcribe` post-processes each transcript line. When it detects a heavily-repeated pattern, it replaces only the repeated run after the first copy with `(indistinguishable speech)`. So `"... some real speech then dungu dungu dungu …"` becomes `"... some real speech then dungu (indistinguishable speech)"` — the meaningful prefix survives, the loop does not. If non-repeated text appears after the loop, that suffix is preserved.

**Detection** — `clip_repetitive_text()` in `vad_transcribe_py/_utils.py` mirrors the offline `repetition_analyzer` tool's `truncate_hallucinated_repeats`. For each candidate pattern length `pat_len` in `2..max_pattern_len` (default 30), it walks the string looking for `text[i] == text[i - pat_len]` over a continuous run of at least `pat_len * (min_repeats - 1)` chars (default `min_repeats=10`). The first hit wins, the detected run is extended until the periodic match ends, and the output is `text[: run_start + pat_len] + "(indistinguishable speech)" + text[run_end:]`.

Lines shorter than 100 characters are passed through unchanged — short utterances like "yes yes yes" or "好好好" are plausible real speech, not model hallucination.

Timestamps and the `prompt_retry` flag are preserved on the truncated segment. The JSONL record also carries `repetition_patterns_clipped`, an array of pattern strings used by `--clip-repetitions` to shorten the repeated tail.

## JSONL output

Every transcript line in the JSONL output carries recovery metadata: `prompt_retry` indicates whether that segment came from the retry path, and `repetition_patterns_clipped` lists repeat patterns used to clip the text. It is empty when no clipping happened. The current clipper stops after the first detected run, so the array contains at most one entry:

```json
{"type": "transcript", "id": "…", "start_ms": 5000, "start_formatted": "00:00:05.000", "text": "…", "end_ms": 8000, "end_formatted": "00:00:08.000", "prompt_retry": true, "repetition_patterns_clipped": []}
```

In the sub-timestamps path, only chunks at index `≥ repeat_index` (i.e. chunks produced by the retry call) are flagged `true`; chunks before the trim point keep `prompt_retry: false`.

Downstream consumers can use this flag to surface or audit the cases where the model needed a second attempt.

## Logging

When a retry fires, the backend logs an INFO line:

- Single-text: `Retrying segment without conditioning prompt (near-duplicate of prior)`
- Sub-timestamps: `Retrying from <Xs> (sub-segment repetition)`

These messages are useful for debugging audio that is hitting the retry path frequently.
